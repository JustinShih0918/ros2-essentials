# ROS 2 Essentials

[![tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/j3soon/ros2-essentials/test-common.yaml?label=tests)](https://github.com/j3soon/ros2-essentials/actions/workflows/test-common.yaml)
[![docs](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/j3soon/ros2-essentials/build-docs.yaml?label=docs)](https://j3soon.github.io/ros2-essentials/)

A repo containing essential ROS2 Humble features for controlling Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and robotic arm manipulators. Please setup an Ubuntu environment before using this repo.

The goal of this repo is to allow seamless robot policy reuse between simulation and reality powered by [(Omniverse) Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/index.html), [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html), and [Isaac ROS](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/index.html). In general, the amd64 images support both simulation and real robot control, while the arm64 images only supports real robot control.

> Please note that this repo is under rapid development. The code is not guaranteed to be stable, and breaking changes may occur.

The documentation is hosted on <https://j3soon.github.io/ros2-essentials/>.

## System Requirements

| Use Case | Platform | Hardware | Software | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Simulation/Deployment | x86_64 | RTX GPU, 500GB+ SSD | Ubuntu 22.04, [NVIDIA Driver](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/nvidia-drivers-installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) | See [this page](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/requirements.html) for more details. |
| Deployment-Only | Jetson | Jetson Orin, 500GB+ SSD | JetPack 6 | See [this page](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/index.html) for more details.

Make sure to install the required software prerequisites before using this repo.

> Some functionalities may still work on lower-spec systems, such as those without GPUs or on operating systems other than Ubuntu 22.04. However, these configurations are not officially supported and may require manual adjustments. Use them with caution.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/j3soon/ros2-essentials.git
cd ros2-essentials
./scripts/post_install.sh
```

> Note that the `post_install.sh` script should be run after each change to the repository (such as switching to another branch or pulling the latest changes).
> In addition, the script can be run with the `-f` or `--force` flag to force removal of hard links if needed.

and then configure the container user ID to match your host user ID by modifying the host `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to include the following line:

```sh
export USER_UID=$(id -u)
```

This step is optional if you have user ID 1000 on host.

> Next, choose a workspace from the table below and follow its documentation to get started. The rest of this document contains optional information.

## Pre-built Workspaces

Pre-built Docker images for each workspace can be pulled by running `docker compose pull` in the corresponding workspace directory. Pulling these images bypasses the time-consuming build process (for both Docker Compose and Dev Containers).

The docker image of the template workspace is share by most of the workspace, allowing saving spaces by sharing common packages. Click on the following workspaces to navigate to their respective documentation.

## Pre-configured Modules

Modules with `Default: ✔️` are installed by default in all workspaces.

Edit the `build.args` section in the `*_ws/docker/compose.yml` file and rebuild the workspace to add or remove modules.

## Building Documentation

```sh
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Create and activate python virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies and start serving
cd docs
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# (Optional) Comment out the `git-committers` block in `docs/mkdocs.yml` to speed up build.
mkdocs serve
# Go to https://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the site.
```

## VSCode Intellisense

If you have installed [Isaac Sim 4.5.0](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/install_workstation.html) to the default path `~/isaacsim`, you can simply enable IntelliSense for editing any Isaac Sim scripts by running the following script:

```sh
scripts/setup_isaac_link.sh
```

This is automatically done by running `./scripts/post_install.sh`.

## Reusing Docker Build Cache

The default `docker` build driver cannot pull pre-built caches from Docker Hub. Using the `docker-container` driver [enables cache reuse](https://docs.docker.com/build/builders/drivers/) but may add [a few minutes of overhead](https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/107) for sending tarballs after the build. You should consider this tradeoff if you choose to switch the build driver.

### Switching to `docker-container` Build Driver

```sh
docker buildx ls
# Install buildx as `docker build` alias
docker buildx install
# Create and use new builder
docker buildx create --name docker-container --driver docker-container --driver-opt default-load=true --use
```

After setting this, using `docker compose build` will use the build cache from Docker Hub. If you want to switch back to the default `docker` build driver, follow the instructions below.

### Switching back to `docker` Build Driver

```sh
# Uninstall buildx as `docker build` alias
docker buildx uninstall
# Unuse the created builder and remove it
docker buildx use default
docker buildx stop docker-container
docker buildx rm -f --all-inactive
```

## Developer Notes

### GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to share build caches between workspaces efficiently. The template workspace is built first, and its cache is then reused by other workspaces. This means that while the template workspace build appears in the commit history, other workspace builds are triggered indirectly and only show up in the GitHub Actions tab. For implementation details, see [commit `024f52a`](https://github.com/j3soon/ros2-essentials/commit/024f52a2bb8a58ad20c03a067560215e8cef6307).

Some current CI builds are flaky and may require re-running.

### Docker Compose Cleanup

```sh
# cd into a workspace directory's docker directory
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker volume rm ros2-gazebo-cache
docker volume rm ros2-isaac-sim-cache
docker volume rm ros2-isaac-ros-assets
```
